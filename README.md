# Challenge_12_Credit_Risk
This is a Jupyter Notbook that uses various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes using a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. This notbook uses a logistic regression model to compare two versions of the dataset. Which resample the data by using the RandomOverSampler module from the imbalanced-learn library.
